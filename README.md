## SLU OJT Management Web App

This was one of the projects that we worked on for our Web Development course. It is comprised of two web apps: one that is used by the students and the other for the teachers.
The students can log their credentials into their site and manage updates in relation to their OJT work. The teachers can log into the portal and see current statuses and updates
made by the students and give remarks based on their evaluations. This project uses a combination of tools including NodeJS, PHP, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
